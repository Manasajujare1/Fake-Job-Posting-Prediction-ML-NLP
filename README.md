# Fake Job Posting Prediction using Machine Learning & NLP

## 📌 Project Overview
Fake job postings are increasingly used to scam job seekers. This project aims to build a **machine learning classification model** that can automatically detect whether a job posting is **real or fraudulent** based on textual and structured job information.

The project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and supervised machine learning algorithms to analyze job descriptions and related fields.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify fraudulent job postings using machine learning
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns
- Apply NLP techniques to process unstructured text data
- Build and evaluate classification models for accurate prediction

---

## 🗂 Dataset
- The dataset contains job posting information such as:
  - Job title
  - Company profile
  - Job description
  - Requirements
  - Benefits
  - Employment type
- Target variable indicates whether a job posting is **real or fake**
